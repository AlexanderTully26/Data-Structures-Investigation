## 8. Tree
- **Defining Characteristics:** A hierarchical structure where each node has a value and references to child nodes.
- **Types of Data:** Any structured data, including hierarchical information.
- **Problems It Solves:** Organizing data in a way that enables efficient searching and hierarchical representation.
- **Real-World Applications:** File systems, organizational charts, decision trees (AI/ML), and XML/JSON parsing.
  
## 9. Binary Tree
- **Defining Characteristics:** A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Types of Data:** Any ordered data or data requiring hierarchical organization.
- **Problems It Solves:** Searching, sorting, efficient data retrieval.
- **Real-World Applications: **Expression trees (parsing expressions), game AI (minimax tree), and Huffman coding (data compression).

## 10. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **Defining Characteristics:** A binary tree where the left subtree contains smaller values, and the right subtree contains larger values.
- **Types of Data:** Numbers, strings, or objects that support ordering.
- **Problems It Solves:** Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations (O(log n) time complexity).
- **Real-World Applications:** Database indexing, auto-complete features, and dictionary implementations.

## 11. Heap
- **Defining Characteristics:** A specialized binary tree where the parent node is always smaller (min-heap) or larger (max-heap) than its children.
- **Types of Data:** Priority-based data, such as tasks with urgency levels.
- **Problems It Solves:** Efficient priority queue management, fast retrieval of the highest/lowest priority element.
- **Real-World Applications:** Priority queues (e.g., scheduling algorithms), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest paths, and memory allocation (garbage collection).

## 12. Graph
- **Defining Characteristics:** A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, which can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
- **Types of Data:** Entities and relationships between them.
- **Problems It Solves:** Representing complex relationships and network structures.
- **Real-World Applications:** Social networks, GPS navigation, recommendation systems, and circuit design.
